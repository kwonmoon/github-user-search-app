## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascrript
- API

### What I learned

It was very fun to learn how to switch the mode based on the user computer's setup as well as the user's selection inside the app.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-TRICKS A Complete Guide to Dark Mode on the Web](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-dark-mode-on-the-web/) - This helped me to understand the general concept of mode changes.
